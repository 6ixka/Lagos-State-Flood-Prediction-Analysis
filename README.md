Lagos State Flood Prediction Analysis
# Introduction
Flooding is a significant concern in Lagos State, Nigeria, due to its coastal location and heavy rainfall. This report analyzes rainfall data to predict potential floods, enabling effective disaster management and environmental planning.
# Data Overview:
Historical precipitation data from 2020 to 2024 was used, including daily rainfall measurements.
# Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning: Errors were corrected, and missing information was filled in.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Patterns and trends were identified.
3. Flood Prediction Model: A machine learning model predicted future floods.
# Exploratory Data Analysis:
Daily and monthly precipitation plots revealed patterns and trends in rainfall, highlighting periods of heavy rainfall and potential seasonal trends.

# Flood Prediction Model:
1. ARIMA Model: An ARIMA model forecasted future daily precipitation based on historical data. The model was trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%.
2. 30-Day Forecast: The ARIMA model provided a 30-day forecast of daily precipitation, plotted with historical data to visualize predicted values.

# Results:
The ARIMA model accurately predicted daily precipitation, indicating potential flood events. The 30-day forecast allows for timely disaster preparedness and planning.

This model predicts that these dates have a high chance of flooding:

•	Date 1: Wednesday, 31st July 2024

•	Date 2: Saturday, 31st August 2024

# Conclusion:
This report demonstrates the effectiveness of using historical rainfall data and machine learning models for flood prediction in Lagos State. The predicted flood events enable proactive measures to mitigate damage and ensure public safety.
# Recommendations
1.	Improve Infrastructure: Upgrade drainage systems in flood-prone areas.
2.	Early Warning Systems: Set up systems to alert residents about possible floods
3. Community Education: Teach people about flood risks and how to stay safe.
